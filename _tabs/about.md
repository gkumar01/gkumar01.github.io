I am a Computational Biologist / Bioinformatic Scientist excited about decoding high-dimensional genomic landscape. I tranform vast genomic data into insight necessary to solve complex health challenges in the era of precision medicine.

In my most recent role as a Senior bioinformatics Scientist at [Caris Life Sciences](https://www.carislifesciences.com/), I developed python enabled pipelines and tools for pathologist to assist in their clinical reporting. Prior to Caris Life Sciences, I was Senior bioinformatics Scientist at [Sonic HealthCare USA](https://www.thyroseq.com/), providing operational support for the thyroseq reference lab.

Prior to that, I worked as Bioinformatics Scientist at [Tempus AI](https://www.tempus.com/) developing and supporting Clinical Grade Oncology pipelines.
